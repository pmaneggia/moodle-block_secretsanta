# Block Secret Santa (`block_secretsanta`)

It is this time of the year again! Play Secret Santa with your friends in a Moodle course with this plugin! Just straighforward, no extras (no opt in or out, no exclusion of people, no wishes/interests...). Maybe there will be a graphical representation of the graph for users with enough rights...

#### Installation
1. Copy the content of this directory into the folder `blocks/secretsanta` inside your moodle installation.
1. Go to the _Site administration -> Notifications_ to start the install process.

#### Supported Moodle versions
The block supports Moodle 4.
